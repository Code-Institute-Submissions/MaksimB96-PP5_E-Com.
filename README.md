## Design

### Design Choices

Website design was inspired by a variety of e-com websites, with the focus of the user having a clear goal. Every section is easy to understand, website flow is easy and navigation is intuative. Path to purchase is made as easy as possible


### Kanban-Board

A kanban board was utilised to set specific goals that would aid agile development! For a detailed view of my goals please find it following the link:

![Kanban Board](docs/kanban.png)

### Colour

Colors used were the bootstrap bg dark with accents of grey and black and the main accent of yellow. These colors were chosen as all these tones play well together adding a layer of depth to the site while maintaining a minimal structure.
<br>

![Color Scheme](docs/colors.png)

### Fonts

Fonts used were Abril Fatface with a fall back of cursive for the majority of headings as well as Lato with a fall back of sans-serif which I found complements the playful design of Abril and adds nice contrasts, as well as allowing users to quickly pick up on the vital points of info.

### Structure

The Structure of the website is clear and concise. Bright colors draw in the user, I untilised the rule of thirds on the home page to make the overall flow pleasant, as well as not over crowding areas with text. The aim was simple and clear, and specific towards an audience interested in honey produce. Navigation is intuative, and the path to purchase is simple and not cluttered.

<br>

The website is made up of multiple pages:

    -The Index
    -The Products
    -The Product Detail
    -The Bag
    -Checkout Area
    -Checkout Success
    -User Profile (If authenticated)
    -News Segment (If super User)
    -Edit/Add segemt (If super User)
    -Allauth essentials

### Bugs

During Development I ran in to a few bugs:

-Media Files not fully rendering even with proper aws deployment:
This was fixed by implementing a media context proccessor.

-

## Deployment

Deployment of site was acheived through these steps:
    -before deployment we soft deploy.
    -This means set up all vars relating to urls and databases and configure the variables
    -After Project completion and soft launch disable, disable_collect static and make sure debug is false
    -Once all is in place commit changes to git hub, followed by deployment to Heroku
    -Once deployment of site is complete you are provided with your app url!


## Future Features

There are a few more feartures that I would like to implement in the future. These Include:
1.User Unsubscribe functionality 
2.Rating System
3.Flesh out the products 
4.A Feedback Section/ Possibly rating system
